**Risk**: Unclear how to view membership details
Users may struggle to find where to view their membership tier, benefits, or renewal date, leading to confusion or support requests.
Reduction measures: Move membership info to a clearer location like the dashboard with labeled text (e.g., “My Membership”).
 
**Risk**: Too much info on booking screen
A cluttered booking screen can overwhelm users and delay class selection.
Reduction measures: Show only essential info first, with advanced filters hidden under a “More options” button.
 
**Risk**: Customer service button is unclear.
Icon only buttons may be hard to recognize for some people, causing users to miss support options which is bad.
Reduction measures: Use clear cut and labeled buttons like “Help” or “Support” in visible sections of the app.
 
**Risk**: Accidental button pushing on some screens.
Poor spacing or placement of buttons may cause users to trigger actions unintentionally.
Reduction measures: Add spacing and confirmation prompts before completing key actions like cancellations.
 
**Risk**: View schedule button is too small.
If this button is to small or maybe hidden, users might miss it and struggle to plan workouts.
Reduction measures: Enlarge the button, use high-contrast design, and place it prominently.
 
**Risk**: Unclear how many people are at a gym
Percentages or vague visuals may not help users understand how busy the gym is.
Reduction measures: Show estimated number of people, "35 people at the gym now", for clarity.

**Risk**: App load times are too long on older devices
Users with mid-range or older phones may experience slow loading times, leading to frustration or app abandonment.
