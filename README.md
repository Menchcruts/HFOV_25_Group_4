## Project overview
This project aims to teach us about software project planning. When finished, we should know how to:
- Conduct surveys to identify stakeholders, user pain points that could be improved and what users actually think.
- Create user story maps to easily visualize the path a user might take to accomplish a certain task and therefore allow us to plan ahead.
- Better organize the flow of developing software with Github projects and milestones.
